GitHub supports several modes of authentication to ensure the security of your account and data. Here are the main methods:

Username and Password: This is the basic method, often combined with two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.
Personal Access Tokens (PATs): These are used instead of passwords for accessing GitHub via the command line or API.
SSH Keys: Secure Shell (SSH) keys are used for secure access to your repositories.
OAuth: This allows third-party applications to access your GitHub account without sharing your password.
SAML Single Sign-On (SSO): Used mainly by enterprises for managing user access.
Passkeys: A newer method that provides a passwordless authentication experience12.
Each method has its own use cases and benefits, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs. Do you need help setting up any of these methods?

Generate and Save: Click Generate token. Make sure to copy and save the token somewhere secure, as you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.
